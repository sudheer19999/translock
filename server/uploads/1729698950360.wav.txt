 know, just before the holiday, the markets, you know, might pull down. But instead of
 pulling down, it has to boil that back to you. Your face, you know, is very, very disturbing.
 Your face have sold 15,000 crores for upstairs today. If I'm not wrong, in a normal day, forget
 about the lean and further collapse in coronavirus. In a normal trading day, the property is going
 to be the highest selling. This week alone, nifty wiped out 1,000 points, and your face
 have sold 15,000 crores, and that Tuesday, the fantastic green prediction.
